</div>

<p>Just a word in regard to this little
book, which we venture to add to the
more pretentious undergraduate literature.
The sketches and illustrations
are those which appeared in the Christmas
number of The “<span class="smcap">Lit.</span>” We do
not present them as masterpieces, but
merely as representing the present literary
work in college along the line of fiction.
Several of the stories are their
author’s “first appearance,” and the
thumb-nail sketches are the first attempt,
we believe, at college magazine
illustrating. It is hoped that other volumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
may in time be added, forming an
“In Green and White” series. If this
vest-pocket volume serve as a souvenir
of The “<span class="smcap">Lit.</span>” and an incentive to story-telling,
it is well.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Ted</span> Tracy sat in
his little back
room, gazed out
of the window,
and sighed. The
sighing was not consequential upon
the gazing, though it might well have
been, for four walls of windows about
a roofed-in court, with a grey sky sullenly
peering in three stories higher,
does not form a remarkably cheerful
spectacle; not even when compared
with a ten-by-twelve room containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
as its sole ornaments a folding
bed, a commode, three chairs, and a
mirror. But Ted’s usually buoyant
soul would have risen above these
surroundings, as easily as the curls
of his cigarette smoke; something
much more depressing squeezed out
that sigh.</p>

<p>Six months before, this young
graduate of a fresh-water college had
come to Boston and entered upon
the twin pursuits of journalism and
agriculture. As a newspaper man,
he had so far succeeded in earning
the munificent salary of $6 per
week, which almost paid for his
room, his laundry, and his cigarettes.
As a farmer, he had sown
with signal success one of the finest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
lines of wild oats
in the city, and
was now finding
some difficulty in
their gathering.
His only relative—the
rich old uncle
common to all fairy tales—had
hitherto settled the periodical deficits
in his accounts with unfailing
good humor and abundant generosity;
but now he had suddenly
thrown up his role of good genius,
objecting, perhaps, to being used as
a patent reaper.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_005" style="max-width: 20.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="Man looking down">
</figure>

<p>So Ted sat and gazed and sighed;
sometimes, to vary the monotony,
he swore. The French dancers
from the “Black Crook,” who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
roomed next door, were screeching
some Parisian street song as grotesque
and inharmonious as their
acrobatics. The parrots and macaws
in the bird store down stairs
answered them back with scarcely
more discordance; and between
them Ted felt sure his environment
would drive him to suicide or drink.</p>

<p>Before he had time to grasp either
horn of the dilemma, however, a
knock at the door ushered in one of
his few welcome visitors. The little
dark chorus girl in “Venus,” who
roomed with her mother two doors
beyond, was pretty enough to attract
Ted’s attention the first time they
met, and modest and womanly
enough in a sweet, old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
way to retain, not only his earnest
admiration, but his hearty respect.
This afternoon she was bubbling
over with happiness, so much so
that she never noticed Ted’s lugubrious
expression.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Tracy,” she began at
once, “I’m to have a part to-night.
Mr. Rice and Miss Tinnie have had
a row, and I’m to do Absurdaria.
You know I’ve understudied it all
the season; and, Mr. Tracy, mother
wants to see it so much, but she
can’t go alone very well; and could
you—would you—be her escort?
I’ve the tickets; and it will be so
kind of you.”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” said
Ted, as she stopped for breath. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
should never have forgiven you if
you had not allowed me to share
in your first night’s triumph.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” replied the girl,
with a charming blush. “But I
must not, will not, fail with mother
there. And I should like to please
you, too,” she added shyly.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_008" style="max-width: 30.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="Woman looking left">
</figure>

<p>So Ted put on his dress suit,
spent the evening in an orchestra
stall at the Park, by
the side of dear little
old Mrs. Burnham,
and was as proud
and happy as she at
“her Eva’s” success,
for although the Princess
Absurdaria is not
the most attractive part in a “comic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
opera” that has many superiors, still
the newcomer in the cast was so
pretty and graceful and young that
the crowded house noticed the
change at once, and manifested its
approval many times. So great was
her success, indeed, that the mighty
Poom condescended to crack a joke
about it, and the shapely star herself
took a thorough mental inventory
of the new favorite.</p>

<p>When the performance was over
Ted and Mrs. Burnham waited for
Eva at the stage door, and they all
walked home together in the clear,
crisp November night. After his
congratulations had been gracefully
tendered and prettily accepted, Ted
was silent, trying a plan for a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
supper for his companions; but Mrs.
Burnham relieved his perplexity.</p>

<p>“You must stop in for a bit of
lunch with us, Mr. Tracy,” said she.
“I’ve gotten up a little surprise for
Eva, and we both want you to share
it, too.”</p>

<p>A dainty little supper it was, more
cosy and homelike and wholesome
than anything Ted had experienced
for years. Alone with these simple
friends, his foolish conceits melted
away, and the good side of his nature
was revealed as it had never
been before in Boston. They were
all very chatty and confidential.
Ted told his troubles, and was tenderly
pitied by Eva and wisely advised
by her mother. Then the latter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
in spite of her daughter’s remonstrances,
told their story—how her
husband had died when she herself
was ill three years before, and how
Eva, finding the burden upon her
shoulders, had pluckily taken it up
and supported her mother in comfort
by her wages as a chorus girl.</p>

<p>“It’s been hard sometimes,
dearie,” said Mrs. Burnham, as she
stroked her daughter’s wavy hair,
“but the worst is over now; and,
thank God, you are as true and pure
a girl as the first night you saw the
foot-lights.”</p>

<p>Ted went back to his little room
with a lighter, braver heart than he
would have thought possible six
hours before. The next day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
for many succeeding days he went
at his work with a dash and vim
that could not help bringing success.
And when, as often he was, tempted
to go back to his old ways, a pair of
clear brown eyes seemed to look out
of a piquant, merry face straight
into his, and to make him refuse
with almost rude abruptness.</p>

<p>In the spare moments, that before
he would have more than wasted,
he wrote out with tender reverence
the life-story Mrs. Burnham had told
him. His heart was in his work,
and the result was a touching and
really well-written little tale. A
great New York editor thought it
was so good, in fact, that he promptly
mailed Ted a check for $25 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
promised his effort immediate publication.
When it did appear the
author read it to the principal characters,
who listened with tear-wet
eyes, and immediately decided that
Ted was without doubt the American
Dickens.</p>

<p>Its further effect was apparent a
few days later, when a gruff but
kindly letter was received from
Uncle John. One of its paragraphs
was as follows:</p>

<p>“I was much pleased with your
story in the <cite>Cosmopolitan</cite>. The
heroine is, I suspect, a flesh and
blood girl of your acquaintance. If
she will marry you, I will settle
$2,000 a year on her and change my
will again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Ted repeated the words to Eva just
as they reached her door, after the
walk home from the theatre one night.</p>

<p>“Can we live on $2,000 a year?”
he asked with a smile, but gravely.</p>

<p>The girl grew pale and trembled;
but when she looked up shyly and
sweetly into his ardent eyes there
was no need for words. With a
happy sigh she threw her arms
around his neck, and their lips met
for the first time.</p>

<p>No one was
ever so near
heaven before
as the happy
pair which New
Year’s found in dingy, stuffy old
Suite Four.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is not remarkable that poets and
bird-lovers consider the spring of
the year preëminently the season in
which birds are to be studied and admired.
The change from the winter
to the spring, from the sombre to the
variegated, the harmony that wakes
the silent woods, the dreamy south
wind that mellows the air,—in truth,
all life, awakening, seems to be striving
to render nature beautiful and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
attractive. To say that spring-tide is
not the best season of the year for
studying birds would be indicative
of ignorance; but to say that spring
is the only season in which birds may
be profitably studied, would show an
equal lack of knowledge.</p><br>

<p>When the leaves redden and fall,
the birds that greeted us so joyously
six months before begin to disappear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Silently they depart, dreading
the rigor of the winter, seeking
a warmer and a sunnier clime. No
longer is the dawn betokened by their
chorus; yet we are far from being
entirely deserted, as there are over
fifty species that brave the cold
weather with us. These winter
birds are generally from the north,
spending their summers in Labrador
or the Hudson Bay region, and
finding a warmer and more congenial
resort in the pine and hemlock vales
of New England. On the other
hand, there is a very respectable
minority who make this their permanent
home. A sunny day suffices
to bring several kinds of them into
the village, and then only are they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
observed by the multitude, though a
few, more interested and zealous,
know where to find them at other
times.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="Bird in tree">
</figure>

<p>Between January and March I
am never unable to find flocks of
the pine grosbeak; they are generally
found in the college park, but if
not there, they will be in Webster
glen, or surely on Balch hill. None
of the birds that spend the winter
with us receive so much notice as
these, on account of the frequency
with which they visit the village in
search of the seeds of frozen fruit,
or the buds on evergreen trees. A
low mellow whistle apprises the
pedestrian of the proximity of the
grosbeak, and the bird is quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
discovered, probably with from six
or eight to thirty companions, that
gradually show themselves
to the admiring
observer. About
the size of a robin,
the females are distinguished
by a soft
yellow coloring,
which becomes a
brilliant scarlet in the male. It is
at once noticed that there are about
five females to one male, which is
natural, when we consider that the
male is the hardier bird, and for that
reason often remains behind in the
northland. It is sometimes called
the “Canadian robin” about here.
I did not appreciate the fitness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the name until last February, when I
found a half dozen of them apparently
leading three half-frozen and
half-starved robins to a place where
they might find food. They are of
about the same size, and fly in a
manner very like the robin, so that
a careless observer might very naturally
consider them a kind of robin.
Last winter they arrived on the 14th
of November, and stayed until the
21st of March. It was perhaps a trifle
strange, that on the 22d of March,
the very day after the last grosbeak
was seen, the spring migration began
with the arrival of robins and
bluebirds.</p>

<p>Though I have never heard the
grosbeak sing, yet, at the setting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the sun on some of the warmer
March days, I have listened to some
of their low, liquid warblings that
were marvels of sweetness, and
proved to my mind their right to be
considered among the finest of our
singing birds.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_023" style="max-width: 20.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_023.jpg" alt="Birdhouse">
</figure>

<p>The grosbeak has a cousin smaller
than himself and rarer, that is
equally interesting, the American
red crossbill. During the
past two years a large
number of these birds
have spent the months of
January and February in
the park, and on account
of their accessibility have
furnished me many interesting
notes. In general coloring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
they closely resemble the grosbeak,
but they are scarcely two thirds its
size. Their crossed bills, which furnish
them their common name, are
their most noticeable and interesting
characteristic. It is a spectacle as
pretty as it is curious to see one take
the seeds from the cone of a fir tree.
The hooked upper mandible serves
to catch hold of and tear out the
seed, while the lower one is a receptacle
for it. With the red crossbill
is sometimes seen the white
species, which is much the rarer
visitant of the two.</p>

<p>But if mention is to be made of
any representative winter birds, we
must notice the chickadee. A rugged
little fellow, undaunted, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the weather be ever so cold, he
salutes us almost everywhere, and as
he passes busily from tree to tree,
seeking his sustenance, he makes
his little remarks in a business-like
way, occasionally approaching his
admirer with a confidential message,
which he rattles off and then flits
away to join some <em>bon camarade</em>.
The chickadees, on account of their
excellent temper and character,
make many friends, and we frequently
find nuthatchers, kinglets,
sparrows, and other small birds
about with them.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_026" style="max-width: 41.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="Bird nest">
</figure>

<p>That these birds are forced to be
gregarious, in order to protect themselves
from hunger and cold, is well
illustrated by the fact that the snowbirds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and pine linnets occasionally
swoop down upon us in flocks of
two to three hundred.
If one
searches the
wooded hills at
some distance
from the town,
rarer species of owls and the like may
be found with partridges, occasionally
Canada jays, and during especially
severe winters straggling Arctic
birds. Indeed, one can hardly walk
abroad without having his interest
well repaid, and rare finds and
new discoveries are of sufficient frequency
to keep the observer enthusiastic.
I think I was first attracted
to these cold weather observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
from selfish motives, for there was a
great charm to me in walking
through pathless fields of snow, and
feeling, from the absence of human
footprints, that no one else was seeing
what I saw and enjoying what
I enjoyed; and if a few days later
I went over the same ground and
found no tracks but my own, this
pleasure was increased. There is
something peculiarly fascinating in
an interesting solitude.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span>, Dan, you must
try to do your best
to-night. There will
be heaps o’ people
at that speaking,
and Squire Barnard’s
hall will be
full, and I fear how you might be
kind o’ shakey when you see ’em all
looking at yer, boy. But be brave
and powerful smart to-night, Dan,
and maybe, some day, somebody’ll
do ye a good turn, and ye might get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a bit more learning.” These were
the words that broke the deep quietness
of a strangely impressive hour
in a home freighted with ill fortune
and cursed by nearly every event. It
was in the days of early American life
when Puritan simplicity and colonial
customs held society in a more
natural state, and allowed the highest
and lowest a more ready approach.
But the home of Dan
Kenashton, though decent, was the
simplest of the simple, and the most
unpretentious of the unpretending.
And on that November evening long
ago, when, in other home-circles the
“husking bee,” the evening kitchen
party, and other ancestral pastimes
told of pleasantly passing days, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
this there lurked a legend of something
wrong. The roughly hewn
timbers which presented their ugly
faces to the two inmates, in the two
solitary rooms of this weird old cot
seemed to speak curses on whomsoever
was within. Even the dusty
old motto, “God Bless Our Home,”
which hung over the crude board
shelf, seemed to bear an ill-omened
import. Beside it was a well kept
picture, a battle scene. Brave men
were defending a fortification, amid
snow and sleet and fire and lead,
against an insidious attack by the
Muskigo tribe on New Year’s eve.
’Neath the feet of those still contending
lay the bleeding bodies of
those who had fought their last.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Did this have any special
meaning in that
home? If so, surely
war is honorable, and
to die in loyal defence
leaves not a stigma
upon one’s posterity.
An old flintlock musket
stood in the corner.
It had not the
appearance of recent
use; the hammer was
rusty and flintless; the
bayonet was blunt and
rusty, too;—but there
it stood as it had stood for years,
becoming such a part of the house
that Dan never wondered at its use
nor questioned its origin. Hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
to it was an old canteen.
They were certainly relics of war,
but war was common in those days,
and the sight of arms familiar. A
few antique pieces of furniture and
the old spinning-wheel completed the
scene in this strange, scanty home.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="i_034" style="max-width: 17.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="Rifle">
</figure>

<p>Dan, in his honest, quiet way, replied
to the simple, yet feeling,
words of his mother, “Indeed I’ll
do all I can to win the prize, but it’s
little use, you know I hav’n’t very
good clothes to wear, and it ’pears
to me that Deacon Ackley and
Squire Barnard himself, and the
other judges, don’t like me very
well, and besides, I haven’t had
any help until I spoke the piece to
General Brockaway to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“What, how did that happen,
Dan?” asked the mother, startled
with a sudden impulse of rage at
the mention of that name.</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t say how it was,
exactly. He happened to hear that
I was going to speak a war piece,
and so he wanted to hear it. I
thought it would be all right to recite
it to him, and I did. He is
writing a book on the old Indian
wars. He said Mr. Kenashton, my
father, was once a good soldier and
fought under him at the battle of
the Creek, that he remembered his
face distinctly, and thought I had
some of his marks.”</p>

<p>“I warn you, my boy, to keep
away from that old man. He’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
friend of ours, Dan, nor was he a
friend to your father. Friend! Oh,
my God! were he not an enemy, less
bitter would be my cup. But it’s
well you know not all, my boy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly understand,” replied
Dan, “but I’ve wondered why
we are not like other people, and
why nobody cares to know us, but
the old General wants to see that
flint-lock and canteen, and says he
intends to say something about
them in his book, and so I told him
I’d take them down to him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Curse the old general and his
book,” said the mother, thinking she
had detected him in some new plot,
and becoming almost mad with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
rage, “take them to him and bid
him keep them; they are not my——ah!
but it’s well you know not
all, Dan; yes, well, indeed.”</p>

<p>Like a lightning flash the whole
past was mirrored in her mind. She
never would believe him a traitor.
Not for one moment. Fort Shelby
may have been betrayed and the
betrayer shot by his comrade captors,
but he was not John Kenashton,
nor is that his musket and canteen.
They are the only signs of
his guilt, and God knows they are
not his. His name may have been
on that canteen, but it was not his
writing, not as I saw him write it.
If General Brockaway had been a
braver man himself, things would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
appear different. But of one thing
I am sure, John Kenashton fell
fighting bravely for what to him was
most dear. Thus meditating to herself
she passed the evening.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="i_040" style="max-width: 15.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="Man standing with hand out">
</figure>

<p>Dan had gone to the speaking.
It was one of those old-time lyceum
contests. The would-be literateurs
of the vicinity had their organization,
and on every Thursday evening
during the colder months assembled
to carry out programmes of a
grave and stately nature, mostly on
literary, political, and agricultural
topics. The occasion on this November
eve was the annual prize
contest, open to all competitors,
when the little surplus in the treasury,
weekly reimbursed by a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
collection to defray “incidental and
other expenses,” was devoted to
prizes which were awarded at the
grand declamatory competition. It
was the great event of the year.
Dan had competed time and time
again since his small
boyhood, and always
without any recognition,
although, did
people dare to utter
their own thoughts,
they would call him
the best speaker. He
had the strong, clear
articulation of an orator—calm,
composed,
yet forcible in utterance.
The flash of his keen, black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
eye would have held any audience
spell-bound, could it once forget
the betrayer of Fort Shelby.
Although he spoke better this time
than ever before, and his preëminence
was more pronounced, his
name was not read on the prize list.
The reason was apparent. A few
justice-loving people shrugged their
shoulders, looked disapproval and
cast sympathizing, if not almost admiring,
glances at his strong, honest
face. General Brockaway, proud of
the results of his instruction, half
wanted Dan to win, and even started
to rise in his seat to interpose objections
to the decisions rendered, but
as quickly as cloud follows sunshine,
evil impulse follows good, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
thought another, he realized the risk
of his prestige and settled back in
his seat. The weekly lyceum was
continued for years thereafter, but
the last prize contest in Shelby town
was over.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Two years had passed and all the
citizens of Shale Valley were preparing
to celebrate in a grand mass
assembly on New Year’s eve the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the repulse
of the Muskigos. This victory
of the settlers, following closely
upon the disastrous affair of Fort
Shelby, practically prevented the
complete annihilation of these settlements,
and on this account New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Year’s had since been held as a kind
of holy day in all Shale Valley.
General Brockaway, the hero of
many conflicts and the chief functionary
of the vicinity, had been
selected to deliver the oration on
this great occasion.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_045" style="max-width: 34.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="Fireplace">
</figure>

<p>For years he had been engaged,
as his leisure hours would permit,
in historical investigations, with special
reference to the conflicts which
were related to this anniversary;
and his eloquent words, fired with
the zest of experience in the events
concerned, were freighted with new
and startling facts. One paragraph
of that memorable oration struck
deep in every heart, and its verification
revolutionized the sentiment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the whole region in one particular
at least. It was this:—“I have a
grave correction to make, a long
continued injury to set right. John
Kenashton, who fought by my side
with dying heroism at the Creek
battle, is not, as was supposed, the
betrayer of Shelby Fort. He fell,
fighting as he always fought, bravely
and loyally, of which fact I have
living and indisputable evidence.”
At this statement all were amazed.
Old men shook their heads, the
women looked volumes of doubt,
and the young keenly bent their attention.
A revelation, mingled with
surprise, sadness, and joy, manifested
itself in the countenance of
the injured son, toward whom all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
eyes were turned instantly. The
general’s words were accepted as
true, and the moral, Puritan sense
of that people, realizing their long-continued
injustice, was quick in
making all possible reparation to the
widow and son of the loyal soldier
who, for a quarter century, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
branded as a traitor. The revulsion
of feeling was so great that
Dan soon became the most popular
fellow in the Valley, and all were
glad to congratulate him three years
afterward, when, on New Year’s eve,
he had won the most charming
belle in Shale Valley, and become
the only heir to General Brockaway’s
large estate.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Harry</span> St. Albans
was good looking,
that was conceded
by all. His father
was wealthy, and
Harry was the especial
admiration of
all the young ladies. Whether
from his ability to entertain, his
good looks, or his father’s wealth,
no party or private theatrical of any
account was a success without him
as principal actor. At college he
had been a member of the dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
club, and taken one of the leading
parts in “The Rivals.”</p>

<p>The wonder of every one was,
that Harry did not get married.
There surely were several young
ladies whom one in his circumstances
might be proud of taking for
a wife, but he stubbornly adhered to
bachelorhood, and prospective mothers-in-law
became more abashed as
he obstinately resisted the charms
of all the young ladies.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_050" style="max-width: 35.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="Woman looking right">
</figure>

<p>It was on the evening of the 30th
day of December
that Harry was at
a party given in
honor of Mrs. Slocum’s
friend. At
first sight of her he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
was captivated; she was the belle of
the season, they told him, and he did
not doubt it. In every movement
there was a charming grace, and
the mellowest pair of blue eyes
seemed to laugh at him all the
time. Her words seemed like
music to Harry’s ears, with that
rich, Italian accent which only a
woman of great accomplishments
possesses.</p>

<p>When he departed that evening,
it was with the greatest reluctance
that he left her side. And as he
put on his coat and went out into
the cold night, his mind still wandered
back to a pair of blue eyes.
In every window he seemed to see
that pair of blue eyes watching him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
What was the trouble? He, a confirmed
bachelor, being so agitated
by a pretty face and a pair of blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Finally he reached his home, and
now he was trying to forget the happenings
of the evening. But those
eyes still pursued him in his sleep.
Upon awakening, he knew that it
was all a dream; yet not all, for
those eyes were a reality.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said his father, “when
you are in the city to-day I wish you
would call on my old friend, Tom
Harris, and give him my best
wishes for his success. To-night is
New Year’s eve, and he is to open
his new theatre, ‘The Grand Royal,’
and his daughter, who has lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
returned from abroad, is to be the
leading actress.” Of course Harry
would be only too glad to call on
his father’s old friend; and the first
place he went, on his arrival in the
city, was to the private office of “The
Grand Royal.”</p>

<p>“Henry St. Albans’ son? Oh!
yes, but you will excuse me for a
moment. I have some urgent business
with my leading actor. Please
step into the office for a moment,”
replied Manager Harris, when Harry
introduced himself.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_054" style="max-width: 21.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="Man leaning on arm">
</figure>

<p>The door was left ajar, and he
could not very well help hearing the
conversation. It seems that Oscar
Redmond, who was one of the most
promising actors of the day, had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
failing of a great many actors, and
would drink occasionally, yet seldom
get intoxicated.
That
morning, however,
he had
been out with
some of the boys, and as all wished to
drink to his success, he had indulged
rather too freely, and in such a condition
he had come to the manager
of “The Grand Royal” and
demanded an exorbitant salary,
above the amount specified in the
contract. Mr. Harris refused, saying
that he would rather close his
theatre than submit to such an outrage,
and Redmond left, declaring
that he would not appear that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Harry,” began the manager as
he returned, “did you”—“Yes, I
heard every word, Mr. Harris; but
perhaps I can aid you in some
way.”</p>

<p>“You?” “Yes, years ago when
I was at college I was considered a
good impersonator and quick to
learn my part,” said Harry, “and
if you have no objection I will learn
the lines this morning and rehearse
with the company in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“But can you take this part?”
said Mr. Harris, with a peculiar
accent on the you. “I don’t want
to have a bad performance on the
opening night, it will almost ruin my
reputation.”</p>

<p>“You can rely on me,” said Harry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
“I played just such a part in ‘The
Rivals’ when at college, and my
friends told me I would miss my calling
unless I took the stage for my
profession?”</p>

<p>“Harry, you’re a brick!” said the
manager, slapping him on the shoulder,
“and if you succeed, I’ll do
anything in my power for you.”</p>

<p>The rehearsal was gone through
with successfully, all being present
except the leading lady, who wished
to save her strength for the evening
performance.</p>

<p>The theatre was crowded, for
Oscar Redmond was an excellent
actor and a great favorite. Just
before going on the stage, Harry
was introduced to the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
actress. He was thunderstruck; it
was the lady with the blue eyes.</p>

<p>Never did actor play with more
enthusiasm and fervor, never was a
love scene more realistic; for the
time being Harry forgot he was
reciting so many words, but he was
pleading his own cause with a love
that knew no bounds. If one had
been watching Harry with an opera
glass, as he knelt at the feet of the
heroine, he could have seen him
raise a dainty hand to his lips and
kiss it. It was all that Harry
wanted; for to him it meant that he
had been accepted—not by the lady
in the play, but by the girl whose
blue eyes had won him the night
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>The audience was thunderous in
its applause, and curtain calls were
numerous. The next day Oscar
Redmond, shamefaced yet curious,
appeared at Mr. Harris’s private
office. The morning papers were
lavish in their praise of the young
actor, and he was anxious to learn
the meaning of it. When he was
told that his part had been taken so
admirably by another, he made his
first New Year’s resolution, which he
has never broken.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Harris,” said
Harry, “I ask, as the fulfilment of
your promise of yesterday, the hand
of the sweetest and best girl that
ever lived, that of your daughter.”</p>

<p>“But what of the young lady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Harry? Surely, she ought to be consulted
first.” “She has already
accepted me,” replied Harry, “it
now remains with you.”</p>

<p>“I am only too glad to give my
consent,” said Mr. Harris, and a
moment later Harry was receiving
congratulations from Oscar Redmond
and a score of new made
friends.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> narrow valley
which nestled
in the lap
of the Ossipee and
Sheep mountains
had already begun to awaken
from its summer reverie. The
early September days had touched
it with their first faint suggestiveness
of autumn glories, and the
second growth maples in the lowlands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
had answered with a few
crimson leaves and golden boughs.
The little Bear Camp brook, which
had hardly moistened the sands of
its sinuous banks during the long,
dry summer, had begun to flow
again. Farther up the valley the
saw-mills of Forest City could be
heard, starting up after their summer’s
idleness.</p>

<p>It were strange if the two shanties,
which adorned in their ugliness
the western side of Sheep mountain,
had not participated in the new life
of the little valley. To the passerby
they were the same patched and
dilapidated huts which they were the
day Pete Larkim and Lize Simonds
had made that memorable “weddin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
tower” to Bear Camp a couple of
months ago. Pete’s “ole man”
and “Ria” had flattered themselves
that their bit of diplomacy, which
had prearranged and carried out
Pete’s marriage to Lize, would bring
them a happy old age of ease and
indolence.</p>

<p>To Pete and Lize, however, their
“gittin’ merred” was but a part of
their day’s outing at Bear Camp and
the Bluff. It meant nothing more
than the enjoyment of the peanuts
together and the satisfying of their
parents’ wishes. Pete still lived
with his “paw” and “maw,” and
spent his days in hunting, while Lize
remained in the Simonds shanty
and scolded the half dozen younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
children as they quarrelled over hoecake
and hominy. Pete’s “ole
man” objected to his spending his
whole time in hunting, and Pete had
taken to crawling quietly from his
bed of straw in the loft long before
Bill Larkim was up, and starting on
his day’s tramp over the steep sides
of Black Snout or Sheep mountain.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="Two men talking">
</figure>

<p>This morning,
however, Pete had
overslept, and as
he took down his
gun, Bill Larkim
rose from the low
bench by the door,
where he had taken
his accustomed
seat to watch for driftwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Naow look er hyar, Pete,” he
said; “there hain’t no call fer yo’ ter
go a huntin’ ev’ry day an’ leave me
ter do the hull o’ the work. Yo’
got ’nough plovers yisterday ter las’
a week.”</p>

<p>“Naw thar wa’n’t nuther,” said
Pete, with a grin. “They’re all
gone a’ready.”</p>

<p>Bill looked up angrily, and blew a
cloud of smoke from between his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“Yo’ can’t fool yer old paw,” he
said, with an emphatic gesture toward
the Simonds shanty. “I ’low I
know who et them plovers yisterday.
Jack Simonds got ter feed hisself
er starve!” and Bill shook his bushy
head of hair and his massive fist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
toward the dilapidated shanty, which
seemed to tremble in very fear.</p>

<p>Pete, who had been leaning on
his gun, tightened his belt as he
muttered, “Lize hain’t goin’ ter
starve ef Jack Simonds does.”</p>

<p>“Ef Lize hed ruther starve than
come ter live with us, as she’d orter,
I ’low we can stan’ it,” continued
Bill, without noticing the interruption.
“What ’d yo’ git merred fur,
ef Lize hain’t goin’ ter help me’n
yer maw, naow we’re gittin’ old an’
rickety? D’ yo’ hyar, Pete Larkim?”
he almost yelled, in his anger.
“Thar hain’t one o’ that Simonds
gang ez gits another drap from me.
Ef yo’ ’re goin’ huntin, yo’ can go;
but ef yo’ ’re to feed that cuss of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Jack Simonds, don’t yo’ never let
me ketch yo’ round hyar agin. Yo’
kin take yo’r chice ter s’port yo’r
paw an’ maw, ez yo’ orter, or them
shiftless Simonds.’”</p>

<p>Pete had stood leaning on his
gun, and digging with the toe of his
cowhide boot a miniature crater in
the soft earth. As his “ole man”
sat down sullenly on his bench, Pete
buttoned up his leather jacket, and,
his gun on his shoulder, shambled
down across the brook and out into
the clearing beyond.</p>

<p>“Lize hain’t goin’ ter starve,” he
kept saying to himself all day, as he
tramped through the rocky woods of
Sheep mountain in search of game.</p>

<p>It was early evening when Pete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
came down with his brace of plover
from the open summit of the mountain
into the shadows which had
settled on the narrow valley.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_070" style="max-width: 24.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="Music symbols">
</figure>

<p>Just where he was going he did
not know; but whenever he thought
of returning to his old home, he
would seem to hear some one say,
“Lize hain’t goin’ ter starve,” and he
would stop, as if to listen. He was
nearer the shanties than he thought,
for once as he paused
he heard the voice of
some one singing down
the mountain path. A
moment later Lize
appeared, and Pete greeted her
with, “Hello, Lize; I’m moughty
glad ter see yo’. It’s been kinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
lonesome on the mounting ter
day.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_071" style="max-width: 48.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="Woman standing">
</figure>

<p>To most, Lize would not have
been good looking, but Pete thought
he had never seen so beautiful a
picture as that of Lize standing in
the rocky pathway in her soiled and
ragged gown of calico. The leafless
twigs of
the pathside
had caught
her hair, and
tangled it till
it floated bewilderingly
about her
freckled face.
A moment before, Pete was thinking
of going home; but now, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Lize questioned him, he answered
quickly, “Goin’ up to Forrest City.
Paw ’lows I can’t go home no
more ’thout I quit givin’ yo’ game,
Lize. An’ yo’ hain’t goin’ to starve,
not ef Pete Larkim knows it. Hyar,
Lize, take these plovers; they’ll
feed yo’ for a day or two. Game’s
moughty scarce on the mounting,
but I’ll git yo’ suthin, Lize.”</p>

<p>As they walked down the path
together, Pete could not help wondering
what made him feel so tenderly
for Lize. Ever since he could
remember, they had made mud pies
together, and quarrelled over their
dams of dirt and rocks which they
had built across the little stream.
In fact, their life acquaintance had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
not been a particularly pleasant one.
But since his father’s interference,
Pete had discovered an attraction in
Lize as simple, yet as strong, as love
can create.</p>

<p>Pete had no difficulty in finding a
home among the shanties of the
mountain “city.” Day after day he
would go after game for Lize, and
every evening she would meet him,
and they would walk together to the
turn of the road, in the cold November
twilight. These walks made
Pete very happy, for he had never
before experienced the joy of doing
a kind deed, and Lize was very
thankful in her simple way.</p>

<p>The December days had brought
the first scuds of snow down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
little valley
from the
already
whitened
summits of
Ossipee
mountains.
The walks
with Lize became less and less
frequent as the snow became deeper,
but she never failed to meet Pete
at the turn of the mountain road,
to receive his gift of game.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_074" style="max-width: 55.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="Decoration">
</figure>

<p>As they met one evening in late
December, Pete hung his head in
shame. His hands were empty.</p>

<p>“’T ain’t my fault, Lize,” he said,
hardly daring to look up. “I hed
moughty fine luck up ther mounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
ter-day, an’ war goin’ ter give yo’ a
real surprise, fur tomorrer’s Christmas,
yo’ know. But paw jest laid
fur me up hyar in the brush, and
stole ever plover I hed. I’m
moughty sorry, Lize, but p’raps”——</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no matter, Pete,” interrupted
Lize. “Maw can make a
hoe-cake fur Christmas. You’ve
ben moughty good ter me, Pete, an’
some day mebbe I can do sumthin’
fer yo’,” and Lize looked at him in
simple thankfulness.</p>

<p>“I’m moughty sorry, Lize,” repeated
Pete. “But bein’ yo’ hain’t
got nothin’ ter eat, can’t yo’ come
up ter the celebrashun ter-night?
They’re goin’ ter hev a real Christmas
tree at the school-house, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the parson’s comin’ up from Bar
Camp an’ bring er lot o’ presents with
him. Mebbe we’ll get one, Lize.”</p>

<p>The deep-set black eyes of Lize
lighted up with evident pleasure at
the thought.</p>

<p>“Mebbe we will,” she answered.
“At enny rate, Pete, I’ll come,
shore,” she called after him, as he
started towards his “city” home.</p>

<p>It was a great event in the history
of the little mountain hamlet, for it
was the first time that Christmas
had ever condescended to visit the
cluster of half a dozen shanties.
The lights were all extinguished,
save in the ten by twenty school-house
where the celebration was
being held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="i_077" style="max-width: 21.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="Decoration">
</figure>

<p>As Pete and Lize came
in from the cold night air
to the warmth and glow
of Christmas which filled
the stuffy little school-house,
they were silent in
surprise. It was something
unheard of, this giving of
presents to friends, much less to
strangers; but as they heard the
story of the first Christmas, and
the message it brought, they began
to realize the true meaning of
<em>Love</em>. As if it were contagious, it
dawned upon Pete for the first time,
that his affection and regard for
Lize was nothing less than <em>love</em>.
He felt as if with the distribution of
the presents and the strings of popcorn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
something new and strange had
come into his rough life.</p>

<p>“I ’low we must er got it, Lize,”
said Pete, as together they ate their
string of corn. “Maw ’lowed I hed
the measles, but she never said
nothin’ ’bout my gettin’ in love.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no disease, Pete,” said
Lize, who had a woman’s intuition
and tenderness in her childish heart.
“Lovin’ hain’t catchin’ no more’n
nothin’. It’s jest er hevin’ er big
heart an’ lettin’ er loose, thet’s all.”
And Lize flushed a little at her evident
display of knowledge. “The
parson ’lowed ez how nobody who
wa’n’t in love orter git merred,” Lize
continued. “’Tain’t that way hyar;
leastwise, I hain’t never heard er nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
bein’ in love up hyar on the
mounting.”</p>

<p>Pete was very quiet now. His
hat was drawn over his deep-set
eyes, and he was playing nervously
with the folds in Lize’s calico gown.
He was evidently thinking. “Lize,”
he said, at length, “I ’low ez we’ve
got it, sartin; an’ we’re gittin’ ole,
too. I’ve known yo’ fur a long
spell, Lize. It’s nigh sixteen year,
hain’t it?”</p>

<p>Lize, who could hardly tell her
own age, ’lowed it war a moughty
long time.</p>

<p>“Wa-al,” said Pete, hesitatingly,
“bein’ ez how we’re in love, Lize,
let’s git merred fur keeps. Thet
wa’n’t no weddin’ last summer, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
paw and maw sent us daown ter
Bar Camp, was it, Lize?”</p>

<p>“A weddin’?” asked Lize,
“naw; we jest got merred. Thar
hain’t no weddin’ ’thout yo’’re in
love; an’ we’ve got it naow, Pete,
sartin;” and Lize looked surprised
at the new thought.</p>

<p>Pete needed no more encouragement,
but taking his slouch hat in
hand he walked nervously to where
the parson was distributing the last
of the Christmas presents.</p>

<p>“Me’n Lize ’low ez we hain’t got
no call ter bother yo’, parson,” he
said, as he looked attentively at a
hole in his old hat. “But me’n
Lize wan’ ter git merred fur keeps,
an’ we ’lowed ez mebbe you’d do it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
fur nothin’, ez we hain’t got no present
ter-night. It only costs half er
dollar,” Pete suggested, as the surprised
parson seemed to hesitate.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_081" style="max-width: 27.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="U.S. half dollar coin">
</figure>

<p>The mention of the
fact that it only cost
half a dollar seemed to
recall something to the
good parson. Before he
could answer, however, Pete continued:</p>

<p>“Thet wa’n’t no weddin las’ summer,
daown ter Bar Camp, ’cause
we wa’n’t in love. But we’ve got it
naow, sartin; an’ we wan’ ter git merred
fur keeps.” Pete looked up
pleadingly.</p>

<p>A moment later, Pete and Lize
stood blushingly, hand in hand, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the group of rough mountaineers.
As the parson put this question
to Pete, “Do you take this girl
for your Christmas present for
keeps?” his dark eyes lighted up
with a new happiness, and he answered
quickly, “I ’low I does, fur
keeps.”</p>

<p>There was a movement of surprise
in the audience as Pete and
Lize went down the narrow aisle,
and one or two of the uncouth
mountaineers instinctively drew their
slouch hats from their heads.</p>

<p>“Whar yo’ goin’, Pete?” inquired
Lize, timidly, as they went out of the
school-house into the Christmas
night.</p>

<p>“Goin’ home, uv co’rse,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“Paw’ll be moughty pleased, fur I
’low ez he hain’t hed nothin’ ter eat
fur mor’’n a month. I tell yo’ what,
Lize, I’ll su’prise him with er Christmas
present. ’Tain’t allus ez paw
gits er Christmas present.”</p>

<p>As Pete and Lize plodded down
the valley road, they were very happy
in their plans for the future.
The dilapidated Larkim shanty
seemed a mansion in their unrestrained
happiness.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Pete
and Lize reached the two shanties
which for sixteen years had been all
that “home” meant to them. Pete
pounded loudly on the rough door
of the Larkim shanty, eager to present
his angry “ole man” his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Christmas present, which had brought
so much happiness to him. In a
moment there was a big bushy head
thrust out the little square window
at the side, and Pete called,—</p>

<p>“Haow are yo’, paw? I’s got a
Christmas present fur yo’.”</p>

<p>“Naw yo’ hain’t, nuther,” broke
in Bill. “What yo’ doin’ ’round
hyar ennyways, yo’ young rascal, yo’?
Be that Lize?” he yelled, as he recognized
the shivering form at Pete’s
side.</p>

<p>“Uv co’rse,” replied Pete. “We’ve
got merred for keeps, an’”——</p>

<p>“Merred!” exclaimed Bill, from
his window. “Hain’t yo’ been merred
all summer, an’ then yo’ lighted
out and left yo’ paw and maw ter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
starve. Yo’ don’t wan’ ter come
sneakin’ ’round hyar, Pete Larkim;
if yo’ do, I’ll shoot yo’. I don’t
want none o’ yo’ Christmas present.”
And the window dropped with a
crash.</p>

<p>For a moment Pete was silent
with astonishment, till Lize, taking
him by the hand, said,—</p>

<p>“Don’t yo’ keer, Pete. It’s
moughty hard luck. But I ’low ez
haow Bill Simonds hain’t fergot.
Yo’ come er long with me, Pete;”
and together they sought refuge under
the roof of the Simonds shanty.</p>

<p>“Paw hain’t no call ter kick us
out,” said Pete, at length. “But
I’m moughty glad we went ter the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>celebrashun, hain’t yo’, Lize?”</p>

<p>It had
been for
me a day of toil and weariness and
grief. Sick in body and heart, I
returned home late at night and
threw myself just as I was upon a
couch. In an instant slumber came,
but not relief.</p>

<p>I seemed again to tread the weary
streets, crowded with the ever-surging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
throngs. On the icy-mirror
pavements, in the blazing windows
of the stores, on the faces of the
joyous purchasers,—everywhere was
the Christmas glow; and once more
in bitterness of spirit I cried out
against the hollow mockery and
sham.</p>

<p>There was a change. All had
vanished save the lights. Nor were
they frigid, blinding, cruel, as before;
a rosy glow, warm, soft, and kind,
filled all the room. Before me stood
an angel form, whence streamed the
radiance. Beautiful was her flowing
robe; beautiful must once have
been her face, but now the deep
lines about the large, appealing eyes,
the quavering of the patient lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and the pallor of the sunken cheeks
had marred its symmetry and grace.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the figure in a
voice plaintive, yet sweet. Unhesitatingly
I grasped her hand, and
straightway we were flying through
the air. The night was inky and
awful. The wind moaned dismally
as it hurled upon us the huge
masses of clouds, threatening and
demon-like, and naught but implicit
confidence in my conductor preserved
me from a sense of loneliness
and of desolation, from an
utter horror like to that of death.</p>

<p>Long thus we flew, outstripping
the swift pursuing blasts, until day
bloomed like a rank marsh flower.
A gloomy, dismal day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Beyond the vision on either side,
a mighty pile stretched; above, it
was lost in the low-lying clouds,
reaching, perhaps, to the very skies
I thought.</p>

<p>Grand the design appeared, yet
grand rather in what it should
have been than in what it was;
for here the walls stood all in
moss-grown ruins, as though shaken
by some overwhelming earthquake
shock, here still unfinished. Everywhere,
besides, had been inwrought
marble blocks and shattered columns
from the ruins that strewed
the plain for leagues around. All
about were men engaged upon the
palace; but though some were
earnestly endeavoring to prop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
leaning walls, or to set the great
stones firm and true, some, I
thought, strove only to cover the
gapping seams with useless tinsel,
while some were even battering with
rams whatever places were the weakest.</p>

<p>Stumbling beneath an arch whose
very keystone threatened to drop
upon us as we went, and then
through dark and ruinous passages,
we entered. We emerged into a
great hall, whose gaudy, gilded
splendor could not long blind the
eyes to the bare foundations protruding
all about and crumbling in
decay. Here a preacher was describing
the true Christmas, yet,
though his words rang with wondrously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
fervid eloquence, they met
but little response in the faces of
his congregation. Unconsciously
my guide approached the speaker,
while her splendor became even
more intense, until it shone almost
like the sun, and yet it might be
gazed upon, so soft and friendly
was it. But even as it blazed most
gloriously it faded, and with a halfstifled
sob the angel turned away.
To my questioning glance she made
reply, “I am Love, and as I come
where love is my effulgence grows
more bright.”</p>

<p>Through ruined chambers and
dark corridors, around black, yawning
chasms, up and down great tottering
stairways, now we passed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
while I held in terror to the hand of
my unmoved conductor. At length
we stood in a city street. Remember,
all was vague and indefinite to
me, for it was but a vision or a
dream. In the great surging mass
of humanity I noted but two beings,
a ragged woman and a little sleeping
child which she was bearing in
her arms. Plainly she was wandering
in search of work. Behind her
stood a black, misshapen something,
gaunt and grisly, wearing a faint
resemblance to the human form,
and upon his gloomy forehead I
thought I read the impress of this
word, “Hunger.” In his hand he
held a lash, and with it he even
beat the shoulders of the woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
compelling her to quicken her weary
steps; of escape she had no hope.
Once she would have sank upon the
pavement; the demon strode before
with a starved and frightful laugh,
and struck the child, which wakened
with a moan. As if in answer to its
call Love drew near, shining with a
subdued but cheerful light. The
tense lines upon the woman’s face
relaxed; she arose and struggled
on, but for a moment only. As the
demon Hunger turned and beheld
Love standing there he rushed upon
her with a fearful cry, then turned
and fled. Not an instant was the
monster’s place unfilled. Another
of his kind, with a still more awful
countenance, upon which was written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
“Despair,” appeared and struck
the woman to the ground; nor did
he cease to rain upon her frightful
blows, while she glared at him in
fierce defiance. I hid my eyes, and
when I looked again woman and
child had vanished and in their
places were two clods of earth.</p>

<p>I fled in terror, for Love was
nowhere to be seen; but at length
I found her weeping bitterly. The
sight of her, even in distress, renewed
my courage to behold other
things, dreadful though they might
be. Yet what need to tell more?
Hour after hour we wandered on,
and always we found only such
scenes of squalid misery or gilded
hypocrisy as well might break the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
hearts of men though they meet
them every day.</p>

<p>At length Love lost the way, and
she wandered through fearful ruins
until, upon the brink of a fearful
chasm just beneath the gloomy
clouds, she sank to earth. Near by
lay stores of all things necessary
for life, yet it was a gruesome place.
“Here we must perish,” moaned my
guide, and from below I saw grisly
Despair rising to drag us down.
But even as Love spoke a rushing
sound was heard above, and a great
glory dissipated all the gloom.
Before us stood another angel, bearing
in his hands an anchor of jewelled
gold. “Did you forget your
wings, my sister?” she asked reproachfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
“How can you die,
being immortal?”</p>

<p>Before her gentleness and confidence
doubt could not stand. Joyfully
we grasped her anchor and
rose with her above the clouds.
And now I saw that the palace did
not reach the skies, but that its topmost
story was, oh! so near the earth.</p>

<p>As we passed beyond the walls I
read in great letters, carved upon
the blocks above the ruinous portal,
“The Social Structure of Christ.”</p>

<p>“Kind Hope,” I cried, “if this be
all that Christ can do for man, in
self-derision do we celebrate his
birth to-day.”</p>

<p>She smiled half sadly, and half
sweetly, for she could never, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
believe, seem wholly sad. “Many
of the stones,” she said, “are fallen.
The inscription read at first not
‘of Christ,’ but ‘of Christendom.’
Before the memory of any living
now the blocks were laid, and those
which have crumbled have fallen, so
that many believe the words were
ever what they are. But turn and
look.”</p>

<p>Far away the clouds had broken
and were all gilded by the rising
sun. There stood another palace,
which seemed much like the first,
yet perfect in symmetry and beauty.</p>

<p>“It is of the future,” I heard
Hope say; “somewhere—beneath,
above, behind, before, within,—somehow,
future borders on that place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
which some call Heaven, the home
of Love, of Knowledge, and of Joy.”</p>

<p>As she ceased to speak I knew
I was alone within my chamber.
The Christmas bells were ringing
merrily, and as I went forth into the
cheerful sunshine and saw the pleasant
sights that I had passed by in
the palace of my dream I felt all
my old despair rung out and a
cheerful, living hope rung in.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">Mrs.</span> Clancy
glanced
around the
kitchen of the four-room
flat on the top
floor of a Broome-street tenement,
and wondered why Clancy didn’t
come. It was almost 7 o’clock,
and he “struck work” at 6. Besides,
to-morrow was Christmas,
and their turkey depended on Clancy’s
ability to get home with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
week’s pay in his pocket. She had
not much confidence in this, for he
had come home with an empty purse
and a full bottle too many times.
So Norah Clancy slipped a shawl
over her head, and started down
stairs. Just as she reached the
door, whom should she meet but
Officer Dorgan, of the 3d precinct.</p>

<p>“Good avenin’, Mr. Dorgan,” said
Norah, her mind full of Mike’s
whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Good avenin’, Mrs. Clancy, and
could I be doin’ anything for yez?”</p>

<p>“Have yez seen onything of my
man?” asked Norah.</p>

<p>Now Dorgan did know where
Clancy was, but he was kind-hearted
and hated to tell Mrs. Clancy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
her husband was endeavoring to fill
himself with bad whiskey at Casey’s
gin-palace on the corner. So Dorgan
told Mrs. Clancy, in a comforting
way, that her man was probably
on his way home, and not to
worry.</p>

<p>With that, Mrs. Clancy started up
stairs, and only stopped to slap one
of “them Linkowski brats,” as she
called the children of Linkowski,
the Polish Jew on the third floor.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_107" style="max-width: 22.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="Drunk man at bar">
</figure>

<p>Dorgan started
for Clancy when
Mrs. Clancy left
him, and, true
to his instinct,
found him trying
to hold up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
one end of Casey’s long mahogany
bar. Dorgan approached him, and
began,—</p>

<p>“Clancy, your wife’s a-lookin’ for
yez.”</p>

<p>Clancy turned around still clinging
to the polished hand-rail, and
recognized Dorgan.</p>

<p>“What’ll yez drink?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Clancy,” said the officer;
“but yez better go home.”</p>

<p>Clancy turned around with an
assumption of gravity and started
for the door, for he was a little afraid
of Norah.</p>

<p>She heard him coming, as he
stumbled up the stairs, and waited
for him. But as he grasped the
knob of the door it opened of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
own accord, and Clancy was precipitated
against the
kitchen table, which was
set for supper. Concluding
that it would be unwise
to move under the existing circumstances,
he remained leaning on
the table and waited. He had n’t
long to wait, however, for Norah
began,—</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="i_109" style="max-width: 22.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="Decoration">
</figure>

<p>“Mike, give me your money!”</p>

<p>He started to remonstrate, but
quailed before the terrible look in
her eye, and emptied his pocket on
the table.</p>

<p>Norah counted it over.</p>

<p>“Three dollars an’ a half is missin’,
Clancy, and yez eat cold corned-bafe
to-morrer, av ye plaze.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>With this, Mrs. Clancy left the
room and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Clancy, left to himself, sat down.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before Mrs. Clancy
returned, and again referred
to the turkey which they would not
eat on the morrow.</p>

<p>This was the straw that broke
the camel’s back. Clancy’s manhood
asserted itself, and he arose in
a dignified manner and started for
the door.</p>

<p>As he reached it he turned around
and, with the air of a king bestowing
a favor, said, “Mrs. Clancy,
yez’ll hov that turkey.”</p>

<p>Clancy walked down stairs and
out into the street, where he stood
for a moment, irresolute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>His ideas on where to procure
the turkey he had so rashly promised
were very hazy, and, furthermore, he
thought Mrs. Clancy had his money.
As he reached his hand down into
his pocket he felt something. He
took it out, gazed at it contemplatively,
and bit it. This seemed to satisfy
his doubts. He had a quarter!</p>

<p>Then he considered what should
be done with it. A quarter would
hardly buy a turkey, and a quarter
would buy considerable in the line
of drink. Still thinking, he strolled
down the street.</p>

<p>As he passed his old haunt a
large white placard, with the following
notice in green letters, attracted
his attention:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_112" style="max-width: 50.25em;">

CASEY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clancy did not hesitate, but entered
the saloon. With determination
in his eye, and all the straight-forwardness
that he could put into
his gait, he marched up to the
bar-tender and inquired about the
raffle.</p>

<p>“Ober dere,” said the man, pointing
to the other end of the room.
“Dere’s anoder chance left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Clancy, with an eagerness born
of despair, deposited his quarter and
drew his ticket, No. 13. “Thot
may be bad luck,” thought Clancy,
“but I’m bound to win.”</p>

<p>Clancy waited with stoical indifference
as the numbers were drawn.
At last he heard some one in the
front of the crowd call out, “Thirteen
wins.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Clancy marched
proudly into the
presence of his wife,
and laid his turkey
before her.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="“Mike.”">
</figure>

<p>“Mike,” she said,
“where did you get
that turkey?” “Mike,”
she said in a louder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
tone, “did you steal that turkey or
beg it?”</p>

<p>Mike did not reply to the calumnies
of his wife. He was asleep.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">They</span> sat upon the
wide piazza of the
St. Sauveur hotel,
gazing through the
August twilight upon the extended
purple of Frenchman’s Bay, the
low-lying islands and erratic cliffs
that have made Mt. Desert the
Mecca of so many pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>“It is strange that we should have
come here together!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Grace Egerton, folding her wraps
about her gracefully.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” responded Ralph
Leighton. “Of course, Grace, we
rather hoped to meet you here; but
you, George, who would have
thought it!”</p>

<p>“It was certainly a pleasant surprise
to meet you,” answered George
Wardsworth. “I must truly consider
myself fortunate,” with an
emphasis on the last word, as he
glanced at the beautiful face of
Grace Egerton.</p>

<p>The glance was intercepted by
Ralph, who was becoming annoyed
at his friend’s earnest endeavors
to be agreeable to his betrothed.
It was with great pleasure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Ralph heard his sister’s voice asking
George Wardsworth if the evening
air wasn’t becoming a little
chilly. Compelled to respond,
George gallantly escorted her into
the parlors.</p>

<p>Drawing his chair closer, Ralph
dwelt with loving words upon his
favorite topic, their engagement.
“And when that happy day shall
come,” he said, “when our engagement
is over and real love begins,
do you think, Grace, that we will be
happier?</p>

<p>“No, Ralph; for it is already
over.”</p>

<p>“What! My God—not that,
Grace: why, but yesterday you
vowed you loved me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she interrupted, her eyes
seeking the ground. “You are
right: one day ago I was yours, to-day
I am another’s. Then I thought
I knew what love was, but I find
that I was ignorant of that passion.
It is cruel,” she said, “but with my
soul in sympathy with another’s, I
could not be faithful to you, Ralph.
Forget me, as unworthy of your
love. I regret the pain I have
caused you. But I”——</p>

<p>“Stop,” he cried. “It is true
you never loved me. Oh! that I
should be deceived by a woman’s
love. Go, and may the curse”——but
with an angry movement she
was gone. With a muttered curse
for George Wardsworth, whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
knew too well was to be Grace’s
successful suitor, and almost maddened
with grief, he strode down the
gravel walk and was lost in the
gathering night.</p>

<p>An hour later he returned, haggard
and broken-hearted; and with
little wonder, for in a few short
minutes all that earth held dear
had been ruthlessly snatched from
him. Yet not all: there was his
sister, whom he loved so sincerely,
she would be his one comfort in
life; but ever before him lingered
the vision of Grace Egerton’s lovely
face.</p>

<p>As he neared the hotel, he paused
and listened. Sweetly floated from
the parlors on the still evening air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the grand words and
melodious strains of
“Lead, Kindly Light.”
It was his sister’s voice, singing as
she never had before, so it seemed
to him. Almost divine became the
music. Such strains as cause us for
the moment to forget the outside
world with its laughter and tears,
and fill our minds with nobler and
better thoughts.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_122" style="max-width: 28.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="Lead kindly light">
</figure>

<p>And though the singer knew it
not, there was one who heard and
never forgot that hymn, which for
the time soothed his wearied heart
as he listened in the silence of the
night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The bustling, good-natured throng,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
crowding New York’s busy thoroughfares,
and the brilliantly lighted
show-windows, told to all that Christmas
eve, with all that it suggests,
had fallen upon the city.</p>

<p>On Fifth avenue a man hurried
past the wealthy and cheerful homes
of the most fortunate citizens. The
electric light glared upon him and
revealed the face of an old friend,
Ralph Leighton. But how changed
from the handsome Ralph of former
days! His unfortunate love affair,
followed by the death of that sister
whom he so dearly loved, had added
many a year to the once youthful
face.</p>

<p>“I might do it,” he muttered as
he strode along, “I might dash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
George Wardsworth from his proud
position to the level of a beggar; I
wonder if the haughty Grace would
come to him then. To-night George
Wardsworth stands on the verge of
financial ruin; if he can stave off his
creditors for another week, the tide
will change, and he will remain as
he is, wealthy, happy, and loved.
To-morrow I will tell the secret to
his creditors, they will foreclose,
and George Wardsworth will be a
penniless man, and I shall have had
my revenge.”</p>

<p>Wrapping his ulster more closely
about him to keep warm his revengeful
spirit, he passed on, but in
a short time paused, attracted by
the unusually cheerful appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of one of the mansions. He gazed
into the window. The sight for a
moment unnerved him. There
seated at the piano amid all the
luxury of the Egerton mansion was
the one who had made him the hardhearted,
revengeful man that he had
become,—with her face turned to a
sofa on which easily reclined George
Wardsworth. How contented and
happy they looked!</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="i_126" style="max-width: 42.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="Woman playing paino">
</figure>

<p>He had not known where Grace
was living, and this sudden discovery
maddened him, and he muttered,
“I will do it. George Wardsworth,
beware!” He started on to carry
out his threat, when the sound of music
recalled him. As though guided
by the hand of fate, Grace had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
turned to the
piano and run
her fingers over
the ivory keys.
Now instrument
and voice chorded
together, and
softly there
came to the revengeful
listener,
the sweet harmony
of Cardinal Newman’s hymn.
He waited through it all, and as</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">lingered and died away, Ralph recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the same hymn, that other
night, when his hopes had forever
vanished. He heard again the voice
of his beloved sister. Even now she
might be watching him from the
star-lit heavens above. How false
was he to her trust, meditating such
vengeance. He hurried away, humming
to himself the words of the
sacred hymn, and the business
house of Wardsworth
&amp; Co.
weathered the
financial storm.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Several</span> years ago, at the junction
of two little streams in a
fertile section of the cotton district,
stood a rickety old blacksmith-shop.
The master of its forge, Remington
Ingleheart, familiarly known as
“Rem,” was a stout, thick-set man,
of slave parentage. He was a thrifty
young fellow, sure of success at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
trade. For some time he had been
“goin’ with a gal,” as he said, about
half a mile up one of the little
streams, but had never come to any
definite understanding, because there
had been but one room to the shop.
By the time of which we write, however,
things were different. An extra
apartment was practically completed.
The neighbors wondered what
“Rem” was up to. When asked
about it, he simply answered that he
was tired “workin’ an’ sleepin’ in
de same place.”</p>

<p>Among all the young negroes of
the vicinity, “Rem” had but one
particular friend. This was Hicks
Gale. Hicks was a sort of blacksmith,
too. In rushes of work he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
would come over and help “Rem.”
One cold December night, “Rem”
had a job on hand that must be
finished before he turned in. How
he wished for Hicks! As if the
wish had anything to do with it,
Hicks actually appeared about nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Hicks!” exclaimed
“Rem.” “Jus’ de man I wants to
see. Take de sledge an’ strack a
little fur me.”</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t presactly what I come
fur,” said Hicks; “but I kin hit you
a few licks, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“What’s on hand?” asked
“Rem,” thrusting the iron back for
a new heat.</p>

<p>“A ball at St. Michael’s, Christmus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
eve,” responded Hicks, in much
glee. “Sim Sprigs is givin’ it, an’
he tole me fur to tell you to be shore
an’ come, an’ fetch Judy. You’ll
be dar, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Coase,” answered “Rem.”
“Ever know me to miss a ball?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_134" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="House">
</figure>

<p>St. Michael’s was a church: a
shabby looking structure on the east
bank of the large stream formed by
the two smaller ones. On the night
of the ball, it was pompously illuminated
by a number of tallow dips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
that peeped uneasily forth from
every nook and corner. The dilapidated
wooden shutters had been
drawn to and fastened with pieces
of heavy twine, to keep out the gusty
blasts. In the centre was a small
stove, which was filled with pine
knots till it gave out the necessary
degree of heat. The crude benches,
on either side of the common aisle,
were gathered into a large heap beside
the door, to make room for the
pedal antics. The most striking
feature was the old pulpit. It consisted
of a low platform, shut in
across the front and half way back
on either side by a rough framework
of boards. Each projecting
corner looked toward a vendor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
stand, laden with the influences
which make “A fool and his money”
soon part.</p>

<p>The form of entertainment which
the negroes call a ball is rather a
comprehensive institution. It may
be given on the slightest provocation,
and under any auspices whatever,
public or private. Ostensibly,
the enjoyment consists in dancing
to the music of a scratchy fiddle.
Really, the interested parties bring
together as many of their friends as
possible for the purpose of disposing
to them of cheap nicknacks and
third-class refreshments at a profit
of three or four hundred per cent.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock on the Christmas
eve in question, St. Michael’s was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
full to overflowing. The din of loud
talking and yelling was deafening.
The voice of Sim Sprigs, the manager,
could be heard above that of
any one else, exhorting the young
bloods to “furmember” their sweethearts,
and “treat ’um often.” The
idea of treating was of primary importance
to the success of the entertainment.
It meant that the
boys were to lavish their last cent
on the girls. In fact, the prompting
in the dance was equipped
with a special figure for such occasions,—“Promenade
to de bar.”
The cry of “treat me” could everywhere
be heard in powerful soprano
tones. If a girl met a boy she knew
she invariably asked him to treat her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
When a boy asked a girl to dance,
she usually answered, “Yup, uf you’ll
treat me fust,” frequently stipulating
the amount of the investment.</p>

<p>“Rem” and Judy arrived a little
late. The first dance was already
in progress. Every one naturally
glanced up to see who had entered.
The newcomers shook off their
slight embarrassment by at once
joining in the waltz. Very soon they
were as much a part of the crowd
as any other couple in the house.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_139" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_139.jpg" alt="Man and woman on bench">
</figure>

<p>As soon as the opening set closed,
there was a general thronging to
“de bar.” “Rem” made his purchases
and retired. With a large
bag in one hand, and Judy on the
other arm, he sought the seclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of the old pulpit. The inclosure
was furnished with only the preacher’s
bench, but that had plenty of
length for two. “Rem” and Judy
sat down, with the bag between
them. The former seized a huge
piece of cake, and intimated to the
latter that she might “dip in.” The
second dance was “sot out.” When
the third was announced, neither
“Rem” nor
Judy had engaged
a partner.
It was natural
and pleasant
enough
for them to
dance together
again. Further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
along, they did not hesitate to
pass over several sets at a time. All
spare moments were spent in the
pulpit. “Rem” kept an abundance
of nicknacks on hand, so that they
might “dip in,” and relieve the embarrassment
of occasional silence.
Until quite late the conversation
was, on the whole, comparatively
general. “Rem” now came a little
more to the point, by remarking that
he had “bin ’templatin’ takin’ a
wife.”</p>

<p>“Is you?” said Judy, simply.
“Dat’s good.”</p>

<p>“Jobs is bin putty brisk dis fall,”
added “Rem,” “an’ I’s got my
yother room all fixed.”</p>

<p>“Is you done picked her out?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
asked Judy, with apparent unconcern.</p>

<p>“Picked her out!” exclaimed
“Rem,” “long’s I bin gwine wid
you, Judy Marshall, now you ax me
who I wants to marry!”</p>

<p>Rosy dawn dispersed the moneychangers
from the temple and
shamed the lovers from the pulpit.
On the following Sunday, St. Michael’s
church was packed with an unusually
large audience, and the
morning service was concluded with
a wedding.</p>

<p>“Judy Marshall,” said the preacher,
“does you solemnly promise to
live up to dis man, lack you ought
ter?”</p>

<p>“I does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Remington Ingleheart, is you
gwine to cherry dis ’oman, whether
she’s sick or no?”</p>

<p>“Sho’s God, I be!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“What</span> if she i-s waiting?
Ha, ha, ha,—hic! it’ll do
her good to wait.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a well dressed,
wealthy young aristocrat of New
York. It was Christmas eve at the
club, and he had sat with his comrades-in-revelry
at cards and wine
till the early hours of the morning,
not thinking of his young wife at
home, alone; and when one of the
soberer of the company asked if his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
wife would be waiting for him, he answered,
with a mocking laugh, “Ha,
ha, ha—hic! it’ll do her good to
wait.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_146" style="max-width: 48.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="Man with cane">
</figure>

<p>Finally the wine-cup was emptied
for the last time, and the party at
the club dispersed. The aristocrat
wandered unsteadily
homeward.
A few
blocks from
his residence
a fire-engine
thundered
past him, and
he gave a
drunken shout to the drivers, as if
to encourage them, and continued
on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>As he turned the corner of the
street on which his house stood,
almost horror-stricken, he saw it
wrapped in flames. The sight
sobered him instantly, and, remembering
his wife, whom he had left
alone seven hours before, he rushed
to the spot, and pushing through the
crowd which had gathered he cried,
“My wife! my God! My wife!
where is she! Is she still in there?”</p>

<p>Not heeding the intense heat, he
rushed to the building and attempted
to climb a ladder resting against
the house, but the firemen held him
back, and led him to a group of his
servants and some officers.</p>

<p>They parted as he came up, and
he beheld there, lying on a rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
blanket taken from one of the
engine horses, the beautiful, white,
but cold form of the one he left a
few short hours before in the beauty
of womanhood. Oh, the agony of
murdered love! He reeled and
sank to the ground, his head fairly
bursting as he remembered her parting
words:</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me to-night, George,
this night of all others, Christmas
eve, the anniversary of our wedding.
You have left me alone every night
for months past. Don’t leave me
to-night.”</p>

<p>Then flashed across his mind his
own words at the club, “What if
she is waiting? Ha, ha, ha—hic!
it’ll do her good to wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>It was too much for his wearied
brain, and his mind gave way.
With the fiendish crackling voice of
a maniac he cried, “Ha, ha, ha—hic!
it’ll do her good to wait.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
